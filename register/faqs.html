            <p class="w3-opacity"><i>at Sand Hill Lake Bible Camp in Fosston, MN</i></p>
            <p class="w3-justify">A group of Mennonite Churches (formerly the North Central Conference of Mennonite Church USA) pool their energy and resources and love putting together a week of camp for youth who arrive from across multiple states.<br> Located near Fosston, Minnesota, Sand Hill Lake Bible Camp is where we gather for a week of Christ-centered, exuberant worshipping, playing, laughing, and learning. During camp, campers will play games, meet new friends, reconnect with old friends, learn about God's endless love for each of us, eat amazing floppy toast, experience God’s love in this camp family, and probably stay up late having a good laugh. <br> Our hope is that campers are able to experience God’s overwhelming love in a real, authentic way. We hope that through the ministry of camp, campers will know that they are loved and that they are called to love others. More than just talking about it, camp invites campers and staff to live it out wildly, experiencing first-hand the world-changing power of God’s love.

                        <p>A little rain is to be expected most years, but it won't slow us down even a bit.

                        <p>It depends on your ages. If you are both in the same camp, you'll see each other all the time, and maybe even be in the same cabin (unless you'd prefer not to be). If you are in different camps, you'll be in separate activities most of the time, but you will be able to see each other from time to time and at all the meals.</p>

                        <p>There will be a time during the day when you can go and buy snacks! While you can bring snacks from home (some campers bring multiple suitcases of snacks!) there are things you can get here like ice cream and popcorn that don't really transport well! For the average camper, they will only need $10 - $20 for the entire week!</p>

                        <p>Weeeell, Yes! You definitely can! BUT the catch is you'll have to turn your cell phone in during check-in, as the use of cell phones is not permitted during camp. We want campers to be living the experience, not trying to record it. Your phone will be stored in a secure area until the last day of camp, when it will be returned to you and you can go back to Snapchatting every minute or whatever.</p>
