                        <p>Yes! As long as you and your friend are the same gender, and in the same camp (see registration form), then just let the staff know who you'd like to bunk with during check-in, and they'll get the rest figured out for you!</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Our days are packed full of good food, fun games, great worship, and hilarious adventures. You'll just have to come to camp to find out!</p>

                        <p>We rent Sand Hill Lake Bible Camp, located near Fosston, Minnesota! It’s on Sand Hill Lake and is a fantastic facility. For more info on the facilities, visit <a href="http://www.sandhilllakebiblecamp.com/">their website</a>.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>A little rain is to be expected most years, but it won't slow us down even a bit. Depending on how hard it is raining, some activities may be moved inside and swimming time may be canceled, but we have a great time either way and we find plenty to do. If you are worried about getting wet, bring a rain poncho, just in case!</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">What is the food like?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Every day features a different menu for lunch and dinner, and breakfast usually has cereal, milk, and floppy toast, as well as other things! If your camper has dietary concerns, please specify on the registration form. </p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>It depends on your ages. If you are both in the same camp, you'll see each other all the time, and maybe even be in the same cabin (unless you'd prefer not to be). If you are in different camps, you'll be in separate activities most of the time, but you will be able to see each other from time to time and at all the meals.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">What if I get homesick?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>As some campers have put it, "You're just so busy all the time that you don't have time to think about people back home!" However, if you do get homesick, our staff will do their best to comfort you, and would be more than happy to let you make that special call to Mom or Dad.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">How much money should I bring?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>There will be a time during the day when you can go and buy snacks! While you can bring snacks from home (some campers bring multiple suitcases of snacks!) there are things you can get here like ice cream and popcorn that don't really transport well! For the average camper, they will only need $10 - $20 for the entire week!</p>
                    </div>


                    <button class="accordion">Can I bring my cell phone!</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Weeeell, Yes! You definitely can! BUT the catch is you'll have to turn your cell phone in during check-in, as the use of cell phones is not permitted during camp. We want campers to be living the experience, not trying to record it. Your phone will be stored in a secure area until the last day of camp, when it will be returned to you and you can go back to Snapchatting every minute or whatever.</p>

                        <p>You can either contact your local church group coming to camp to get a ride, or drive yourself! If you aren't sure of the nearest group to you that is coming to camp, feel free to send us a message and we'll get it sorted out! We want to see you here!!</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>You can, but campers will not get the text until they get their phone back at the end of the week. God has blessed us with a beautiful week of camp and we welcome the opportunity to step away from the distractions of life and dive into real life all around us. As such, campers are not allowed to have cell phones during the week of camp. Staff will hold cell phones in safe-keeping for the week and return them to campers as they leave on Saturday. If you need to reach your camper during the week of camp, you can call or text:<br> -Ron and Karri Muff at <a href="tel:218-204-1343">218-204-1343</a> or <a href="tel:218-204-0925">218-204-0925</a><br> -Les Hochstetler at <a href="tel:541-207-5633">541-207-5633</a>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes! It is always exciting for a camper to receive news from home during the week. However, mail travels rather slow, so make sure to send your letter 2-3 days before you would like it to arrive. The address is Mennonite Youth Camp at Sand Hill Lake Bible Camp 1046 250th Ave Fosston, MN 56542</p>

                        <p>Yes! In fact, many campers bring their own snacks. However, there are three full meals a day and inexpensive snacks available at the camp canteen during the day.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">What if my child gets homesick?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Homesickness happens, especially in younger children. Our staff are ready to help campers acclimate to camp, build friendships and battle homesickness. They are experts in reaching out to hurting hearts and helping them find their place in the camp family. We have a high staff-to-camper ratio, so campers will not be left feeling alone.</p>

                        <p>There are limited scholarships available to help cover the cost of camp. Contact your local pastor first (or send us a message if you do not have a home church involved with Bible Camp) about receiving help financially with camp. While we are more than happy to help where there is need, these arrangements must be made before camp. </p>

                        <p>People support camp in many ways and we welcome whatever you are ready to offer. Here are some ways others have helped from the comfort of their own home-- babysitting for a parent serving on staff, Driving a van of campers to camp, Praying for our ministry leading up to camp and during the week of camp, Sending notes of encouragement to the leaders and staff, Making cookies to send to camp for our Jr> Camper Milk & Cookies time, Making a financial donation to our scholarship fund for campers so that families who aren't as financially fortunate can still send their children to camp, and many other ways. <br>For more information on how you can serve in any of these ways, please fill out our contact form and we'll get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
